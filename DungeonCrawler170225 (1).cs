Behind you the foul enemy totters for but a moment before slumping to the ground in a cascade of guts. The only sound that fills the crackling silence is the ringing of your blade as you once again sheathe it. Your enemy was no match for your lightning reflexes, it seems. A smug smile slips upon your lips.",
                "You unleash a flurry of blows against the creature in a well-practiced staccato, so fluid as to almost be like a dance. Your enemy howls as it reels away from you, barely able to fend you off before regrouping for one final, desperate last stand...",
                "Your acrobatic prowess pays off as you weave your lithe body effortlessly past the enemy's defences in a series of spinning leaps and dives, like a leaf floating gracefully upon the wind. You pick your moment with well-timed precision. Your strike lands true and cripples your enemy.",
                "Despite your unmatched skill your enemy proves to be tough. A cold bead of sweat trickles down your brow as even your best strike has yet to slow them down. If anything, your powerful attack has only incensed them further, as they flail wildly to desperately keep you at bay.",
                "Sweat shimmers your brow as you ruggedly persevere through your opponent's defences with steely grit. Finally, they fall and you take your chance. It's not long before all that lays before you is a bloodied tangle of intestines and gore. Breathing a heavy sigh of relief, you thank your stars that it's over.",
                "You swing your weapon and manage to finally knock your opponent off balance. Before you land the killing blow, however, they roll back to their feet, cursing you as they clutch a bloody gash in their side. Time is running out for them, and they know it, but it only seems to strengthen their resolve.",
                "You parry your opponents strike and riposte. Your strike is received with a blood-curdling yowl of anguish as the enemy staggers backwards. They are momentarily fazed by your attack. But it's not long before they once again close in for the kill.",

When you open them you find you're slashing at empty air and your enemy lies dead. \nWell, if skill won't see you through, I suppose sheer dumb luck just might...",
                "The enemy closes in but are almost as surprised as you are when you land a lucky blow. Their eyes bulge as blood gushes forth from the gaping wound delivered by your quivering hands. They glower your way. A lump catches in your throat as you realise that they're done toying with you...",

                "Your knees knock, your heart thumps against your chest, and your hands shake so badly they're scarcely able to keep hold of the weapon in front of you. \nWho are you kidding? You're no fighter. Why didn't you just follow your heart and take up crochet? \nThe enemy bounds towards you ready to strike. You hurl away your weapon and dive for the corner, folding in on yourself and hoping the fierce enemy will just forget about you or something...\nWhen you finally chance a glance back, you find the enemy slowly rocking on their feet, an expression as if they were hang gliding over hell is etched on their face. Then you look down. \nYour weapon appears to have ricocheted to where the sun don't shine. \nThe enemy looks at you with pleading eyes, before those eyes cross, and the enemy flops backwards. \nHenceforth, word shall be told of this deed, and your enemies will shudder.",
                "In a flurry of instants so bizarre they belong in a circus, you flail your weapon losing your balance in the process and slamming into the enemy 'drunken-fist' style, before themselves tripping over you, and somehow skewering themselves on your weapon. You only just manage to retrieve it before the enemy, bleeding profusely, dizzily stumbles upright.",
