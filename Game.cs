You hurl away your weapon and dive for the corner, folding in on yourself and hoping the fierce enemy will just forget about you or something...\nWhen you finally chance a glance back, you find the enemy slowly rocking on their feet, an expression as if they were hang gliding over hell is etched on their face. Then you look down. \nYour weapon appears to have ricocheted to where the sun don't shine. \nThe enemy looks at you with pleading eyes, before those eyes cross, and the enemy flops backwards. \nHenceforth, word shall be told of this deed, and your enemies will shudder.",
